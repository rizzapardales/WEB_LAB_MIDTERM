            <div class="card1">
                <p>My name is Rizza Mae R. Pardales, I'm 19 years old and
                                I grew up in Pandacan, Manila. I love music and my favorite
                                band is munimuni, and this band is my safe place. I shuddered
                                when someone had the same musical taste as mine. I loves cats
                                and prefers to adapt stray cats instead of buying imported ones
                                because the cats that are sold in pet shops are in good hands with
                                the owner of the shop and someone will buy them, unlike stray
                                cats, some of them are getting harmed on the street and no one is
                                taking care of them.
    
                                Little things makes me happy, when you remember a little
                                thing about me, it makes me happy, listening to my favorite bands makes me happy, random
                                compliments make me happy, foods make me happy, bonding with friends and family makes me
                                happy. It’s easy to make myself happy.
                                My hobbies are watching Japanese movies, playing with my cat, and listening to music.
                                I became a fan of Japanese movies when I was scrolling on tiktok and I saw one of the
                                scenes of a Japanese movie titled Marmalde Boy. The scene was the girl was lying on the bed
                                when the boy came to the clinic. Suddenly, the girl pretended to be asleep. Then the boy kissed
                                her on her lips. The girl was shocked and still pretended to be asleep. I felt butterflies in my
                                stomach at that scene, so I was curious about the movie and wanted to watch it. Then, after
                                that, I enjoyed the movie and started watching Japanese movies. After watching a lot of
                                Japanese movies, I felt in love with the culture of Japan and someday I hoped to travel to
                                Japan. Watching Japanese movies is my stress reliever.
                                Also one of my hobbies is playing with my cat. When I feel drained in school, my cat
                                is my energizer. I loves cat so much that I can’t live without one. And lastly is listening to
                                music. I can’t go outside without my earphones. I love to listen to music wherever I
                                goes. Even in doing my homework, I listens to music for to be productive.
                                My talent is digital sketching. I just discovered it when the quarantine started. Out of
                                boredom, I tried to draw and discovered that I have a skill in drawing. I drew different
                                people my friends, family, and idols. I made an art account on Instagram for me to post my
                                artwork.
